## Themes over the years

To have an ensemble view on the topics of the programs, the number of occurencies of each word by year was added. The wordcloud below offers a nice way to visualize the evolution of different themes over the year. The dropdown on top of the cloud has four options : Genra, Topics, Persons and Locations. The slider at the bottom allows to pick a year between 1900 and 2017, it can be navigated with the arrow keys once selected. There is way more data for the last decades and very little for the begining of the 20th century.

### Word war II
As expected, the main topic of the years between 1939 and 1945 is the world war II. What is interesting to observate is the evolution of the surrounding topics. In 1939 we can see the importance of national or war oriented words like "army", "armed conflict", "patriotism" or "international relatinships".
<a href="#container" onclick="set_cloud(1939,'Topics');">Take me to 1939</a>. Even in this context the second main topics are art related (history, litterature, dramatic art, writer). Now the funny part for the years <a href="#container" onclick="set_cloud(1942,'Topics');">1942-43</a> we get "rationnement" and "recette culinaire" which translates to rationing and cooking recipes. Around the <a href="#container" onclick="set_cloud(1945,'Topics');">end of the war</a> peace is the second word, followed by "military surrender", "military release" and "armistice".


### Rising concerns about terrorism
We only explored the topics of programs, so let's see what the persons have to offer in recent year. <a href="#container" onclick="set_cloud(2010,'Persons');"> 2010</a> Serge Gainsbourg (vie héroïque) came out, this is also the year of the football wordcup in South Africa.<a href="#container" onclick="set_cloud(2013,'Persons');"> 2013</a> Matthieu Chedid new album "Îles" came out and he also did an internation tour this year. <a href="#container" onclick="set_cloud(2014,'Persons');"> 2014</a> Group Etal Islamique, Etal Islamique come big. This is the year when ISIS gained global prominence when it drove Iraqi government forces out of key cities. <a href="#container" onclick="set_cloud(2015,'Persons');"> 2015</a> Group Etal Islamique, Etal Islamique, Charlie Hebdo
<a href="#container" onclick="set_cloud(2015,'Topics');"> 2015 topics</a> Islam, terrorism


### Why bells ?
From <a href="#container" onclick="set_cloud(1956,'Topics');">1956</a> to <a href="#container" onclick="set_cloud(1960,'Topics');">1960</a> the top topic is "cloche" which translate to "bell". The term appears from nowhere and completly disapears the following years. Such results are hard to explain with only our history knowlegde so we dig into the data. As a matter of fact, there wasn't much to explain, we found out that there was a radio program that lasted for three years that was about different church's bells around Switerland. Other than that there was no further information. This example shows that even if topics like the World War II seem to have a meaning in term of word occurencies, sometimes it only means someone was motivated enough that he recorded the different soung of bells.
