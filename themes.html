## Themes over the years

<blockquote>
    <p style="text-align:left"><i> 1. What type of programs were produced in each time period? What/Who are the dominant
        themes/characters for the different historical periods ?<br>
    </i></p>
</blockquote>

To have an ensemble view on the topics of the programs, the number of occurrences of each word by year was added.
The word cloud below offers a nice way to visualize the evolution of different themes over the year.
The dropdown menu on top of the cloud has four options : Genres, Topics, Persons and Locations.
The slider at the bottom allows to pick a year between 1900 and 2017, it can be navigated with the arrow keys once selected.
There is considerably more data for the last decades and very little for the beginning of the 20th century.

### World War II
As expected, the main topic of the years between 1939 and 1945 is the World War II.
What is interesting to observe is the evolution of the surrounding topics.
In 1939 we can see the importance of national or war oriented words like "army", "armed conflict", "patriotism" or
"international relationships".

(<a href="#container" onclick="set_cloud(1939,'Topics');">Take me to
    1939</a>)
Even in this context the second main topics are art-related (history, literature, dramatic art, writer).
Amusingly, for the years
<a href="#container"
   onclick="set_cloud(1942,'Topics');">1942-43</a> we get "rationnement" and "recette culinaire" which translates to
rationing and cooking recipes. Around the <a href="#container" onclick="set_cloud(1945,'Topics');"> end of the
    war</a> peace is the second word, followed by "military surrender," "military release" and "armistice".


### Rising concerns about terrorism
Let's see what the persons have to offer in recent year. <a
        href="#container" onclick="set_cloud(2010,'Persons');">
    2010</a> is the year that the movie Serge Gainsbourg (vie héroïque) came out, this is also the year of the football
world cup in South Africa. Both of these themes, clearly trending in the RTS coverage.<a
        href="#container" onclick="set_cloud(2013,'Persons');"> In
    2013</a> Matthieu Chedid's new album "Îles" came out and he also did an international tour that year. <a
        href="#container" onclick="set_cloud(2014,'Persons');">
    2014</a> Group Etat Islamique (ISIS) comes big. This is the year when ISIS gained global prominence when it drove Iraqi government forces out of key cities.
<a href="#container" onclick="set_cloud(2015,'Persons');">
    2015</a> "Group Etat Islamique" and  "Etat Islamique" are still dominant, but now "Charlie Hebdo" is added to the bigger terms.
Let's go back to the topic section to see how they look like for the
<a href="#container" onclick="set_cloud(2015,'Topics');">same
    period</a>. The same subject have emerged with the terms "Islam" and "terrorism".


### Why the bells ?
We conclude this section on an amusing observation. From <a href="#container"
                                                            onclick="set_cloud(1956,'Topics');">1956</a> to <a
        href="#container"
        onclick="set_cloud(1960,'Topics');">1960</a> the top topic is "cloche" which translates to "bell".
The term appears from nowhere and completely disappears the following years. Such results are hard to explain with only our history knowledge so we dig into the data.
As a matter of fact, there wasn't much to explain, we found out that there was a radio program that lasted for three years that was about
different church's bells around Switzerland. Other than that there was no further information.
<!--This example shows that even if topics like the World War II seem to have a meaning in term of word occurrences, -->
<!--sometimes it only means someone was motivated enough that he recorded the different soung of bells.-->
