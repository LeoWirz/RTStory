## Themes over the years

1. [=\> LEO](#) What type of programs were produced in each time period? What/Who are the dominant themes/characters for the different historical periods ?
2. [=\> LEO](#) General evolution of the emissions: How long does a show run (how many seasons)? What are the influence factors ? Is it linkable to the audience type ? 

To have an ensemble view on the topics of the programs, the number of occurencies of each word by year was added.

### Word war II
As expected, the main topic of the years between 1939 and 1945 is the world war II. What is interesting to observate is the evolution of the surrounding topics. In 1939 (should link the cloud here) we can see the importance of national or war oriented words like "army", "armed conflict", "patriotism" or "international relatinships". Even with in this environment the second main topics are art related (history, litteratur, dramatic art, writer).

1942-43 we get "rationnement" and "recette culinaire"

1945-46 peace is the second word 

### Rising concerns about terrorism

### Why bells ?
From 1956 to 1960 the top topic is "cloche" which translate to "bell". The term appears from nowhere and completly disapears the following years. Such results are hard to explain with only our history knowlegde so we dig into the data. As a matter of fact, there wasn't much to explain, we found out that there was a radio program that lasted for three years that was about different church's bells around Switerland. Other than that there was no further information. This example shows that even if topics like the World War II seem to have a meaning in term of word occurencies, sometimes it only means someone was motivated enough that he recorded the different soung of bells.
