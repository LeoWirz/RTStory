    <p style="text-align:left"><i> 4. How did the RTS coverage of important social phenomena like the sexual revolution,

We have chosen to study some of the major social phenomenas of the 20th century. <br>
Looking at the various plots below, we can see some trends appearing :<br>

<b>Note: Hover over the bar plots to see the co-occurrences for a given year.</b>
<br>
A co-occurrence happens when words show up frequently together (un a cirtain year).
In some years, there is no dominant co-occurence. This is because we set a threshold and filter the words with co-occurrences
lower the threshold.


### Women's Voting Rights

For women's voting right, the co-occurrences peaks at 1971 when a referendum was held in Switzerland.
In the following years, presumably because it's more or less a resolved issue. However, there are some exceptions.
The last time the subject passed our threshold was in 2017, as the Saudi women gained right to vote in certain elections.<br>

### Homosexuality

In the case of Homosexuality, we observe that there was absolutely no mention of the topic until 1960s! The interest in
the topic picks at 2003.
We observe that in the first appearances, the dominant co-occurences are "films" (movies), "livre" (books) showing that
artists were trying to talk about the subject. Whereas in the last years, although the number of occurrences has
not changed (even decreased over the last five years), the dominant co-occurrences are marriage, children and medicine
which shows the progress made on the subject.

### Terrorism
Finally, for terrorism, it's interesting to see that after every peak, there is an important dip in the occurrences,
in the following year.

The co-occurrences here give nice insights about major terrorist attacks over the last 50 years. You can see for example, amongst others:

1. Vietnam and US war in 1964
2. l'affaire Gordji and Mitterand in 1988
3. September 11 attacks (reflected in 2002)
4. Madrid attacks in 2004
5. Paris attacks in 2015
