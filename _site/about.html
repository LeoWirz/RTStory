## Introduction
_Radio Television Suisse (RTS)_ is the main broadcasting organization in the French speaking Switzerland (*Suisse Romande*). Together with SRG and SSR (their German and Italian counterparts) they form the national media.

We obtained nearly 90 years of data of RTS broadcast, from 1930 until 2017. With an expansive dataset from such a media outlet, we wondered what kind of social questions we can answer.

We started with the belief that RTS being a news/entertainment medium, many of the social and international trends and events that shaped the Swiss in the 20th century can be studied and visualized.
Therefore we set out to answer theses questions:

### Research Questions

1. What type of programs were produced in each time period? What/Who are the dominant themes/characters for the different historical periods ?

2. How has the RTS covered the news around the globe ? How equitable was the coverage? Is there any noticeable bias?

3. How has RTS coverage evolved across the years?

4. How did the RTS coverage of important social phenomena like the sexual revolution, women's voting right, and terrorism evolved over time?

5. How has the distribution of genders for anchors and presenters evolved over the course of the years? Was there a gender bias? If yes, how is it changed?
